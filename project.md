 # A list of project for metabolomics course


 # Group A

 Studying the metabolome variation of _Biscutella laevigata_ upon herbivory (_Plutella xylostella_) 

 - 3 plants before and after herbivory (24 hours)

# Group B

Chemotaxonomic study of Rosaceae family. 
Number of samples to determine. 

Check in the full list https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/taxonomical-preparator/blob/f8e853b0038a64ad8ea1a801a013848985f070b3/data/out/species_list_croisee_final.csv

Find 20 samples, ideally 2 or 3 groups 


# Group C

## WT vs mutant (_Arabidopsis thaliana_)

Would require to be ready by next week though
Relative quantification

## Untargeted metabolomics
_Wollemia nobilis_ versus _Auracaria auracana_ phylogenetic study

## _Psychotria bacteriophila_
Compare leave nodules with Fabaceae roots nodule 

## "Fluorescence" compounds in specific plants

## _Erythroxylum australe_ and metteloidine
Check for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteloidine occurence in _Erythroxylum australe_
